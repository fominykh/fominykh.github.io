<h2>About</h2>
<p>
	Hi! I am a researcher and project manager working in the area of Technology-Enhanced Learning. My main focus is on teaching at the university level, collaborative learning, and 3D simulations, but I work with other target groups and technologies too.
</p>
<p>
	I am happy to start working on a new ambitious Research-and-Innovation project <a href="http://wekit.eu/">WEKIT</a>, funded by EU under Horizon 2020 programme. The video presents the industrial trials of the WEKIT platform conducted in 2017.
