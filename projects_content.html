		The project objectives are to build on multi-discipline research (e.g., human-centred methodology integrates cognitive models, ergonomics, understanding of workerâ€™s well being) to accelerate how we identify, acquire and exploit skills valued by industry. Get high take-up by early adopters (e.g., in manufacturing). Augment training in situ with live expert guidance, a tacit learning experience and a re-enactment of the expert, in knowledge-intensive environments where effective decision making, often in new situations, has high impact on effectiveness in production. Bring learning content and technical documentation to life via task-sensitive Augmented Reality (AR). Make final products flexible for workplace integration via industry-standard repositories and toolkits.

2011&ndash;2012: <b> Cultural Awareness in Military Operations (CAMO)</b>
	<p> <img src="res/camo.jpg"></p>
	<p><i>Cultural Awareness in Military Operations (CAMO) is a research project led by the Norwegian Armed Forces in cooperation with NTNU and University in Oslo. The project has two goals: first &ndash; gaining first-hand experience of educational use (opportunities, applications, and limitations) of the 3D virtual worlds within the framework of military operations; and second &ndash; building internal expertise in terms of a larger effort in the future.</i></p>

<p><i>This virtual world is designed and developed specially for educational purposes, and it has an integrated set of tools for a number of learning activities. The main original feature of vAcademia is 3D session recording, which allows to capture dynamically everything in a given location in the virtual world, including positions of the objects, appearance and movement of the avatars, contents on the interactive boards, text and voice chat messages. Recorded sessions are stored on the server and available for watching in a 3D or a 2D-preview format.</i></p>

</ul>
<p><i>Enabling Creative Collaboration through Supportive Technologies (CoCreat) is a project, supported by the European Commission under the Life Long Learning programme. The project identified a number of problems in the society (e.g. technological environments, learning landscapes (ecosystems) and interaction between different generations) and the evidence in research that there is a need for a range of new learning practices in complex and dynamic learning environments in order to tackle these problems. The aim of this project is to find out how to enhance creative collaboration by applying the theory of collaborative learning. The outcome of the project will be increased competence in acting and learning in complex and dynamic environments where collaboration and creative solutions of problems are required.</i></p>

<h2> Virtual Research Arena (2010)</h2>
<p> <img src="res/vra.jpg">
<br>Virtual Research Arena (VRA) at the Virtual Campus of NTNU is a meeting place for researchers, students and public; a place for visualizing and promoting research projects.
